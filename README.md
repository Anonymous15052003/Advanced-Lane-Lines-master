# Lane Prediction Model

--> Our project implements a lane detection and tracking pipeline for analyzing images and videos to identify and visualize lane lines on the road.

--> It leverages computer vision techniques, such as color thresholding, histogram analysis, and polynomial fitting, to robustly detect lane lines in different scenarios.

-->This project serves as a foundation for building a robust lane detection system, applicable in autonomous vehicles, advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS), and other computer vision applications related to road scene analysis and navigation.
